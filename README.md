# codacy-clang-tidy

**Warning: This is a work in progress, it is not yet usable.**

A standalone tool that converts [Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/)
diagnostics to Codacy's format. It allows the integration of Clang-Tidy into your Codacy workflow.

## Usage

The upload of results for a commit is done in two steps:
 - uploading all results
 - telling Codacy that it can run the rest of the analysis

For this a [project API](https://support.codacy.com/hc/en-us/articles/207994675-Project-API) token is required.

```bash
export PROJECT_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
export COMMIT="COMMIT-UUID"

clang-tidy "<clang-tidy-configs>" | \
./codacy-clang-tidy-"<version>" | \
curl -XPOST -L -H "project_token: $PROJECT_TOKEN"
    -H "Content-type: application/json" -d @- \
    "https://api.codacy.com/2.0/commit/$COMMIT/issuesRemoteResults"

curl -XPOST -L -H 'project_token: $PROJECT_TOKEN' \
	-H "Content-type: application/json" \
	"https://api.codacy.com/2.0/commit/$COMMIT/resultsFinal"
```

For self-hosted instalations:

```bash
export PROJECT_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
export COMMIT="COMMIT-UUID"
export CODACY_URL="CODACY-INSTALLATION-URL"

clang-tidy "<clang-tidy-configs>" | \
./codacy-clang-tidy-"<version>" | \
curl -XPOST -L -H "project_token: $PROJECT_TOKEN"
    -H "Content-type: application/json" -d @- \
    "$CODACY_URL/2.0/commit/$COMMIT/issuesRemoteResults"

curl -XPOST -L -H 'project_token: $PROJECT_TOKEN' \
	-H "Content-type: application/json" \
	"$CODACY_URL/2.0/commit/$COMMIT/resultsFinal"
```
